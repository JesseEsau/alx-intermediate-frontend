## 📄 About This Project

This project is part of my learning journey with **ALX Africa**. This project is from the **alx-intermediate-frontend** repository.
It focuses on learning and practicing **Semantic HTML**, **accessibility**, and **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**.

The main goal is to build a web page that is:

* Well-structured using semantic HTML elements
* Easy to read and use with screen readers

By working through the tasks step by step, I’m learning how to:

* Improve accessibility using **ARIA roles**
* Make web pages more usable and user-friendly
